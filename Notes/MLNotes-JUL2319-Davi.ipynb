    "   Charles Davi is a former financial lawyer who made a number of algorithms for genralized machine learning. \n",
    "   He has written numerous papers on them and maintains a [Reseach Gate page](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Davi). <br>There, he posts updates to his project and his writings on the subject. They are free to use for academic purposes only.\n",
    "\n",
    "He went over one of his papers(A New Model of Aritifical Intelligence). It was written on an earlier algorithim, in which he first showed how it worked to break up a complex image, then how it predicted the probability of a turtle going left or right.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithims are supposed to be very fast, and effective(a 100% predication rate on homemade test data, and approximately 90% on other datasets including minist), even on inferior hardware(some 'crappy' $200 Lenovo laptops). He claims no  formal education in algorithims, and appears to use Information Theory to drive his research. The algorithims can apprently work on any type of data, being able to find structure in various types of data. "
